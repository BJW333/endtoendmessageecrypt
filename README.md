End-to-End Communication Programs
-------------

Overview
-------------

This repository contains two Python programs designed for end-to-end communication between a client and a server. The programs establish a communication pipeline, allowing data to be exchanged securely and efficiently between two endpoints.

Files:
-------------
endtoendclientcopy.py - Client-side script to send data to the server.
endtoendserver.py - Server-side script to receive and process data from the client.

Requirements
-------------
Before running the programs, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

socket
ssl (if secure communication is implemented)
json (if data is exchanged in JSON format)
You can install any additional packages using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
-------------

1. Running the Server
The server script should be started first to listen for incoming connections from the client.

bash
Copy code
python endtoendserver.py
This script listens on a specified port (defined in the code) for any incoming connection requests from the client.

2. Running the Client
Once the server is running, you can initiate the client script to connect to the server and send data.

bash
Copy code
python endtoendclientcopy.py
The client will connect to the server at the designated address and port, and initiate the communication process as defined in the script.

Configuration
-------------

Both the client and server scripts can be configured by modifying the following parameters inside the code:

Server IP address: Specify the IP address of the server to which the client should connect.
Port: Ensure the port in both the client and server scripts matches for successful communication.
SSL/TLS (optional): If using SSL/TLS for secure communication, ensure the proper certificates are set up.
Example Workflow
Start the server:
bash
Copy code
python endtoendserver.py
Run the client to connect to the server:
bash
Copy code
python endtoendclientcopy.py
The client will send a message (or data) to the server, and the server will receive it, process it, and potentially send a response back to the client.

Notes
-------------
Ensure the server is hosted on a machine accessible to the client, especially if running across different networks.
If using SSL/TLS, ensure the proper certificates are configured for secure communication.
Troubleshooting

Connection Refused Error: Ensure that the server is running before starting the client and that the correct IP address and port are used.
Timeouts: Increase the timeout setting in the client or server script if the connection takes too long to establish.
SSL Issues: Double-check the SSL certificates for mismatches or expiration if secure communication is used.
